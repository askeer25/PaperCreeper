      "**Title:** Image Analysis Based on Nonnegative/Binary Matrix Factorization\n",
      "**Authors:** Hinako Asaoka, Kazue Kudo\n",
      "**Published:** 2020\n",
      "**Summary:** Using nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), a matrix can be decomposed into a nonnegative matrix and a binary matrix. Our analysis of facial images, based on NBMF and using the Fujitsu Digital Annealer, leads to successful image reconstruction and image classification. The NBMF algorithm converges in fewer iterations than those required for the convergence of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), although both techniques perform comparably in image classification.\n",

      "**Authors:** Jacob Chakareski, Immanuel Manohar, Shantanu Rane\n",
      "**Published:** 2016\n",
      "**Summary:** We consider the problem of accurately and efficiently querying a remote server to retrieve information about images captured by a mobile device. In addition to reduced transmission overhead and computational complexity, the retrieval protocol should be robust to variations in the image acquisition process, such as translation, rotation, scaling, and sensor-related differences. We propose to extract scale-invariant image features and then perform clustering to reduce the number of features needed for image matching. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are investigated as candidate clustering approaches. The image matching complexity at the database server is quadratic in the (small) number of clusters, not in the (very large) number of image features. We employ an image-dependent information content metric to approximate the model order, i.e., the number of clusters, needed for accurate matching, which is preferable to setting the model order using trial and error. We show how to combine the hypotheses provided by PCA and NMF factor loadings, thereby obtaining more accurate retrieval than using either approach alone. In experiments on a database of urban images, we obtain a top-1 retrieval accuracy of 89% and a top-3 accuracy of 92.5%.\n",

      "**Title:** Deep Approximately Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Clustering\n",
      "**Authors:** Yuning Qiu, Guoxu Zhou, Kan Xie\n",
      "**Published:** 2017\n",
      "**Summary:** Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a widely used technique for data representation. Inspired by the expressive power of deep learning, several NMF variants equipped with deep architectures have been proposed. However, these methods mostly use the only nonnegativity while ignoring task-specific features of data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep approximately orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization method where both nonnegativity and orthogonality are imposed with the aim to perform a hierarchical clustering by using different level of abstractions of data. Experiment on two face image datasets showed that the proposed method achieved better clustering performance than other deep matrix factorization methods and state-of-the-art single layer NMF variants.\n",

      "**Title:** Robust Non-Linear Matrix Factorization for Dictionary Learning, Denoising, and Clustering\n",
      "**Authors:** Jicong Fan, Chengrun Yang, Madeleine Udell\n",
      "**Published:** 2020\n",
      "**Summary:** Low dimensional nonlinear structure abounds in datasets across computer vision and machine learning. Kernelized matrix factorization techniques have recently been proposed to learn these nonlinear structures for denoising, classification, dictionary learning, and missing data imputation, by observing that the image of the matrix in a sufficiently large feature space is low-rank. However, these nonlinear methods fail in the presence of sparse noise or outliers. In this work, we propose a new robust nonlinear factorization method called Robust Non-Linear Matrix Factorization (RNLMF). RNLMF constructs a dictionary for the data space by factoring a kernelized feature space; a noisy matrix can then be decomposed as the sum of a sparse noise matrix and a clean data matrix that lies in a low dimensional nonlinear manifold. RNLMF is robust to sparse noise and outliers and scales to matrices with thousands of rows and columns. Empirically, RNLMF achieves noticeable improvements over baseline methods in denoising and clustering.\n",

      "**Title:** Application of Fuzzy Clustering for Text Data Dimensionality Reduction\n",
      "**Authors:** Amir Karami\n",
      "**Published:** 2019\n",
      "**Summary:** Large textual corpora are often represented by the document-term frequency matrix whose elements are the frequency of terms; however, this matrix has two problems: sparsity and high dimensionality. Four dimension reduction strategies are used to address these problems. Of the four strategies, unsupervised feature transformation (UFT) is a popular and efficient strategy to map the terms to a new basis in the document-term frequency matrix. Although several UFT-based methods have been developed, fuzzy clustering has not been considered for dimensionality reduction. This research explores fuzzy clustering as a new UFT-based approach to create a lower-dimensional representation of documents. Performance of fuzzy clustering with and without using global term weighting methods is shown to exceed principal component analysis and singular value decomposition. This study also explores the effect of applying different fuzzifier values on fuzzy clustering for dimensionality reduction purpose.\n",

      "**Title:** Separable Quaternion Matrix Factorization for Polarization Images\n",
      "**Authors:** Junjun Pan, Michael K. Ng\n",
      "**Published:** 2022\n",
      "**Summary:** Polarization is a unique characteristic of transverse wave and is represented by Stokes parameters. Analysis of polarization states can reveal valuable information about the sources. In this paper, we propose a separable low-rank quaternion linear mixing model to polarized signals: we assume each column of the source factor matrix equals a column of polarized data matrix and refer to the corresponding problem as separable quaternion matrix factorization (SQMF). We discuss some properties of the matrix that can be decomposed by SQMF. To determine the source factor matrix in quaternion space, we propose a heuristic algorithm called quaternion successive projection algorithm (QSPA) inspired by the successive projection algorithm. To guarantee the effectiveness of QSPA, a new normalization operator is proposed for the quaternion matrix. We use a block coordinate descent algorithm to compute nonnegative factor activation matrix in real number space. We test our method on the applications of polarization image representation and spectro-polarimetric imaging unmixing to verify its effectiveness.\n",
